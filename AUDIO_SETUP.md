# Audio Setup Guide

## Current Implementation

Your Flutter music app now has full audio playback functionality using the `just_audio` package. Here's what's been implemented:

### Features
- ✅ **Real audio playback** - Press play buttons to hear actual audio
- ✅ **Play/Pause toggle** - Toggle between playing and paused states
- ✅ **Next/Previous tracks** - Skip between songs using the mini player controls
- ✅ **Auto-play next** - Automatically plays the next song when current song finishes
- ✅ **Real-time UI updates** - Play buttons and progress bars update automatically
- ✅ **Stream-based state management** - Clean, reactive UI updates

### Audio Sources
Currently using royalty-free demo audio from:
- `https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/` - Bell ringing and buzzer sounds for testing

### How to Add Your Own Audio Files

#### Option 1: Local Assets (Recommended)
1. Place your audio files in the `assets/music/` folder
2. Update the `pubspec.yaml` to include your files:
   ```yaml
   assets:
     - assets/music/
   ```
3. Update the `MusicService` to use local assets:
   ```dart
   Song(
     id: '1',
     title: 'Your Song Title',
     artist: 'Your Artist',
     albumArt: 'https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg',
     audioUrl: 'assets/music/your-song.mp3', // Local asset path
     duration: const Duration(minutes: 3, seconds: 45),
   ),
   ```

#### Option 2: Remote URLs
1. Use direct URLs to audio files:
   ```dart
   audioUrl: 'https://your-server.com/audio/song.mp3',
   ```

### Supported Audio Formats
- MP3
- WAV
- AAC
- OGG
- And more (supported by just_audio package)

### Testing the App
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
2. Run `flutter run` to start the app
3. Tap any play button in the song list to start playback
4. Use the mini player at the bottom for full controls

### Troubleshooting
- **No audio**: Check internet connection for remote URLs
- **Permission errors**: Ensure audio permissions are granted
- **Build errors**: Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

### Next Steps
- Add local audio files to `assets/music/` for better testing
- Implement a full-screen player with seek bar
- Add volume controls
- Implement playlists and shuffle functionality
