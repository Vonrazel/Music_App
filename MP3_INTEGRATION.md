# MP3 Integration Guide

## Your MP3 File: "Gaspari - Kodak Blu Lyrics Habang habol.mp3"

### ✅ What's Been Implemented

1. **AudioPlayer Initialization** - The `just_audio` package is properly initialized in `music_service.dart`
2. **playMusic() Method** - A dedicated function to play your specific MP3 file
3. **pause() Method** - Function to pause the current audio
4. **dispose() Method** - Enhanced with error handling for proper cleanup
5. **Dedicated Play Button** - Added to `home_screen.dart` that calls `playMusic()`
6. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling for missing files and network issues

### 📁 File Setup

1. **Create the audio directory:**
   ```
   flutter_application_1/
   └── assets/
       └── audio/
           └── Gaspari - Kodak Blu Lyrics Habang habol.mp3
   ```

2. **pubspec.yaml is already updated** to include:
   ```yaml
   assets:
     - assets/audio/
   ```

### 🎵 How It Works

1. **Your MP3 is the first song** in the playlist (ID: '1')
2. **Dedicated "Your Music" section** at the top of the home screen
3. **Play button calls `playMusic()`** method specifically
