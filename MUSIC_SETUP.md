# 🎵 Music Setup Guide

## Why You're Hearing Sample Music

The app currently plays sample/demo tracks because:

1. **Copyright Protection**: I cannot include actual copyrighted songs (like "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd) without proper licensing
2. **Legal Compliance**: Using real song URLs would violate copyright laws
3. **Demo Purpose**: The sample tracks demonstrate the app's functionality

## 🚀 How to Add Your Own Music

### Option 1: Add Local Music Files (Recommended)

1. **Prepare Your Music Files**:
   - Convert your songs to MP3 format
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (under 10MB each)
   - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `blinding_lights.mp3`)

2. **Add Files to Project**:
   ```
   flutter_application_1/
   ├── assets/
   │   └── music/
   │       ├── song1.mp3
   │       ├── song2.mp3
   │       └── song3.mp3
   ```

3. **Update the Music Service**:
   Open `lib/services/music_service.dart` and replace the song entries:

   ```dart
   Song(
     id: '1',
     title: 'Your Song Title',
     artist: 'Your Artist Name',
     albumArt: 'https://your-album-art-url.com/image.jpg',
     audioUrl: 'assets/music/your_song.mp3',
     duration: const Duration(minutes: 3, seconds: 45),
     isLocal: true, // Important: set this to true for local files
   ),
   ```

### Option 2: Use Royalty-Free Music

1. **Find Free Music**:
   - [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/)
   - [ccMixter](http://ccmixter.org/)
   - [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com/)
   - [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/)

2. **Download and Add**:
   - Download the MP3 files
   - Add them to `assets/music/` folder
   - Update the music service as shown above

### Option 3: Use Streaming URLs (Legal Only)

If you have permission to use streaming URLs:

```dart
Song(
  id: '1',
  title: 'Your Song',
  artist: 'Your Artist',
  albumArt: 'https://your-album-art.jpg',
  audioUrl: 'https://your-streaming-url.com/song.mp3',
  duration: const Duration(minutes: 3, seconds: 45),
  isLocal: false, // Set to false for remote URLs
),
```

## 📱 Testing Your Music

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Tap any play button** on the song tiles
3. **Check the mini player** at the bottom
4. **Use controls** to play/pause/skip

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Unable to play song" Error
- Check if the file path is correct
- Ensure the file is in the `assets/music/` folder
- Verify the file is a valid MP3 format
- Check your internet connection for remote URLs

### No Sound
- Check device volume
- Ensure audio permissions are granted
- Try restarting the app

### File Not Found
- Double-check the `audioUrl` path in the music service
- Make sure the file exists in the assets folder
- Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`

## 📋 Example: Adding "Blinding Lights"

1. **Download the song** (legally, of course)
2. **Rename to** `blinding_lights.mp3`
3. **Place in** `assets/music/blinding_lights.mp3`
4. **Update music service**:

```dart
Song(
  id: '1',
  title: 'Blinding Lights',
  artist: 'The Weeknd',
  albumArt: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493225457124-a3eb161ffa5f?w=150',
  audioUrl: 'assets/music/blinding_lights.mp3',
  duration: const Duration(minutes: 3, seconds: 45),
  isLocal: true,
),
```
